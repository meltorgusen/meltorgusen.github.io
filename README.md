## git flow

__do not ever pull or push master__. 

1. `dev` is the working development branch. Do all work in `dev`, merge all
   changes locally back into `master`, switch back to `dev`, and then run `npm
   run deploy`

2. `npm run deploy` will push `dist` to master.

3. push `dev` up to sync the development environment.
